      <h2>A little introduction</h2>
      <p>  Forever curious, I would like to be a "Jack(ie) of all trades and maybe master of a few things". I have an academic background in Business and Economics and later I dabbled into journalism as well. I am currently based in Asia and have just embarked on an entrepreneurial journey. I am motivated by learning, creativity and personal growth and I believe in following one's bliss in life and contributing something meaningful and positive to the world in the meantime. </p> 
    

       <h2>What I used to do?</h2>
       <p>I used to work as bond trader for three years in Hong Kong for Citigroup and subsequently I worked as a business/financial journalist at different locations in the world. My latest job which I left earlier this year was working as a communication manager for a Private Equity company.  </p>

    
      <h2> Contact Information</h2>
