    <h2>A little introduction</h2>
    <p>Hopelessly curious, my goal in life is to be a "Jackie of all trades and maybe master of a few things". I am currently based in Asia and have just embarked on an entrepreneurial journey(or so to say someone who is just really enjoying her unemployment status). In my previous lives, I had worked as a trader and a financial journalist, and now I have a new found love in building websites. I believe in following your bliss in life and contributing something meaningful and positive to the world in the meantime.</p>
